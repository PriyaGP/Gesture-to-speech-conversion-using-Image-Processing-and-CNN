# Gesture-to-speech-conversion-using-Image-Processing-and-CNN
The gesture used by the differently abled people are often not understandable so these signs are converted to the speech using image of the sign captured and using CNN. We have used 20 basic signs to predict. 
Model: CNN
Language: Python

This model is initially trained by the signs that we give as input. Many more signs also can be added and the training and test sets also can be increased. For Speech conversion gTTs is and played by pressing the enter key.
The model can also be further developed as Video Processing and used for predicting sentences.
The demo video is attached below:

The images are first captured, then trained and then it predicts the sign
Run the Data Processing code and give the signs as input and then run the training code to process the images.
Finally run the CNN model and it will predict the images
Or else the train and test datasets are readily available which can be downloaded and used for giving as input to CNN by running the Training and Prediction code.
